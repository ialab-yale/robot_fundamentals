Note that a body needs a geom which you specify within the body tag. There are several kinds of geometries you can define (and even custom ones using an .stl file). \n",

Prismatic (linear), revolute (rotation), spherical (roll pitch yaw), and many more. You should explore the mujoco xml documentation and see the kinds that exist. Each joint will have a specific set of flags that you need to fill out and reference frames that connect bodies together. \n",

    "It is often beneficial to have a reference frame attached to a body which can be accessed at any time (e.g., think of the location of a camera or sensor).

Check out the example below on a double pendulum and check out the xml file to see how to setup actuators. As with joints there are several kinds of actuators. The type will vary from application to application and some are more appropriate than others and depend on how the robot is designed. \n",

    "The code below is what an xml file to describe your robot looks like. We can also import the code as a string into mujoco so you can create the robot straight from your code and edit how it looks and is configured. Compare this code with the a1.xml file located in this repository. "
