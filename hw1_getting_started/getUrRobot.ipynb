    "# Your First (Simulated) Robot!\n",
    "In this notebook you will run Mujoco, a physics simulator that we will be using for the class. You shoul study the API for Mujoco as we will be using the python wrappers which directly map to the C code it was written in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mujoco works in the following way: A model and data structure compose the simulator. The model provides the geometric, kinematic, structural information while any data e.g., generalized coordinates, velocities, contacts, etc., is stored in the data structure. The data is created from the model and a model is created from a configuration file which defines the robot the environment parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "We create a robot model by using an `.xml` file which is provided in the A1 folder. The `.xml` file defines the simulation parameters, the structure of the robot, transforms, joints, dynamics, geometry, sensors, actuators, and anything else in the environment. Take a look at the composition of the one provided by the A1 robot in the a1 directory. These files are similar to the more common `.urdf` files which stands for Universal Robot Description Format. These files, like `.xml` describe the robot and the environment and can be converted from one to another. In many other simulators and robotics toolbox, a `.urdf` is often used to describe the robot. There are a few advantages and disadvantages for using either format. If you download the source code for mujoco from Deepmind, they provide with a `convert` function which can transform a `.urdf` to a `.xml` file and vice-versa. I recommend exploring both files which are provided in this repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go through the steps of importing, creating a model, data, and visualizing your first robot. "
